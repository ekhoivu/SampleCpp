Final Reflection
****************

There are three things I would like to reflect on for this semester. First, your style of teaching fits me. I enjoy one class a week and leave the other one for personal studies and workshop. Very practical. You can, however, make it better by providing more sample codes for us to study from. The ones from the OOP website is not particularly helpful. I also find that since the other professor is writing the workshops, there are things he only mentioned in his class that were helpful, but we were never told the same information. 
Second, many of the workshops are great. Some, however, suffer from very confusing sentences and instructions, making them way more time consuming than they should be. Overall, they were helpful in giving us the practice we need, but could be improved to be much better. 
Third, the final project was good. There were times when everything was too much, considering all the milestones and workshops were due at the same time. For future semester, please review and space them out better. 
Overall, I have really enjoyed your class. I will certainly choose you again for future courses, prof. Thank you!
